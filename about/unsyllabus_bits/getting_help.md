As a student, I can sometimes feel overwhelming to balance academic pressures, social life, and personal challenges. I remember the first time I sought help for my mental health. At first, I was hesitant to reach out for help because I didn't want to be seen as ‚Äúweak‚Äù or incapable of handling things. I was nervous about sharing my feelings and experiences, but the counselor was incredibly understanding and supportive. The initial step of seeking help can make a difference in your life. It's okay to ask for support and that mental health is just as important as physical health. If you're feeling stressed, anxious, or just need someone to talk to, I encourage you to reach out and use the mental health services available.
