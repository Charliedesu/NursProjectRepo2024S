# One example of my meal prep

Hi! One of my ways to maintain a sense of well-being is by cooking my hometown dish, Stir-Fried Spicy Beef. There are research suggests that spicy foods can benefit mental health by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood lifters. This dish not only brings a taste of home, but it's also simple to prepare. The  protein is sliced sirloin beef, which is easy to cook and easy enough for other dishes throughout the week. Although cooking is hard, but I found it very fun and relaxing when I finished.
