#### Girls band cry

Girls Band Cry one of the best band anime I've ever seen. The show is packed with life lessons and inspired me to keep chasing my dreams. It’s a simple, heartfelt story about a group of girls dealing with personal issues who step out of their comfort zones, form a band, and go after their dreams, even when the world doubts them. It’s a great anime for anyone needing a little encouragement and a reminder to keep pushing forward.
